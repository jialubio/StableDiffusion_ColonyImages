# StableDiffusion_ColonyImages

This code leverages [Tiny Autoencoder](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), a distilled version of the Stable Diffusion VAE, to reconstruct bacterial colony patterns. Remarkably, even without fine-tuning, the model is capable of authentically reconstructing microscopic images. By clustering and visualizing the latent embeddings, it is demonstrated that these latents are informative and can effectively distinguish between different bacterial strains. Thus, TAE may be useful for biological images as a **foundation model**.
